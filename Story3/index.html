  Northern Boulevard in Queens is now being called the “New Boulevard of Death” as a spike in pedestrian deaths leaves citizens living in its path fearing for their safety. </p>
<p>
  According to the Department of Transportation, 13 people have died in traffic related accidents on Northern Boulevard since 2012. Additionally, 317 pedestrians have been injured on the same stretch of road. </p>

<p>
  The original “Boulevard of Death”, Queens Boulevard, had a peak of 18 traffic deaths in 1997, but since Bill de Blasio’s 2014 Vision Zero Initiative, the slaughter on Queens Boulevard has effectively come to an end due to redesigning the street with bike lanes, concrete medians and sidewalk extensions.

<blockquote> According to the Department of Transportation, 13 people have died in traffic related accidents on Northern Boulevard since 2012. </blockquote>

<p>Residents living along the most dangerous intersections along Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and Corona are questioning if the DOT will ever give their “Boulevard of Death” the same treatment. </p>

<p>The DOT gets calls and complaints about Northern Boulevard quite often, but according to Craig Chin, the city planner: “We highly value these types of comments, but we need to see what will be the most viable to implement. That takes time.”
